# Turtle_Race_Game
This Python program creates a turtle race game using the turtle graphics module.  The screen is set to 800×600 pixels, and the user is asked to bet on a turtle’s color.  Six turtles (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, pink) are created and lined up at the left side of the screen.  Once the race starts, each turtle moves forward by a random distance between 1 and 6 steps in every loop.  The race continues until one turtle crosses the finish line (x > 375).  The program then checks if the user’s bet matches the winning turtle’s color and prints “You Win!” or “You Lose!” in the console.  Finally, the program waits for a mouse click to close the window.
