🐢 Turtle Race Game

Get ready for some fun with this colorful Turtle Race Game built using Python’s turtle graphics! 🎉

In this game:

Six turtles (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, pink) line up at the starting line.

You place your bet on which turtle you think will win.

The race begins, and each turtle moves forward at random speeds.

The first turtle to cross the finish line is declared the winner! 🏆

You’ll find out if your guess was correct or not.

This project is a beginner-friendly way to explore:
✅ Python’s turtle module for graphics
✅ Random number generation for unpredictability
✅ Loops and conditions for game logic

Perfect for learning Python basics while having fun watching turtles dash across the screen!
